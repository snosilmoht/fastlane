1) Module names should be lowercase with underscores instead of spaces. (And should be valid module names for importing.)

2) Variable names and function/method names should also be lowercase with underscores to separate words.

3) Class names should be CamelCase (uppercase letter to start with, words run together, each starting with an uppercase letter).

4) Module constants should be all uppercase.

E.g. You would typically have module.ClassName.method_name.

5) Module names in CamelCase with a main class name identical to the module name are annoying. (e.g. ConfigParser.ConfigParser, which should always be spelt configobj.ConfigObj.)

6) Also, variables, functions, methods and classes which aren't part of your public API, should begin with a single underscore. (using double underscores to make attributes private almost always turns out to be a mistake - especially for testability.)
