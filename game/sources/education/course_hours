STUDENT LOANS:
https://studentloanhero.com/featured/how-student-loan-interest-works/

"The most important terms to look out for are:

Disbursement date: The date the funds arrive and interest starts accruing
Amount borrowed: The total amount borrowed in each loan
Interest rate: How much you have to pay to borrow the funds
How interest accrues: Whether interest is charged daily or monthly
First payment date: When you have to make your first loan payment
Payment schedule: How many payments you have to make
Lenders understand that most full-time students do not have an income, and if they do, it is not enough to cover student loan payments while in school. As a result, it’s often possible to avoid making payments while you’re in school.

For students that demonstrate need, the government offers subsidized Direct loans. If you qualify, the government pays your interest while you’re in school, so your balance doesn’t grow. Once you graduate, though, the interest becomes your responsibility.

Unsubsidized loans, meanwhile, charge interest from the day the loan is disbursed. Since you aren’t required to make payments, interest will build up, and you’ll graduate with a loan balance higher than you started with.

Do Parent PLUS loans accrue interest the same way? Unfortunately, there are no subsidized loans for parents. Additionally, regular repayment begins 60 days after the loan is completely disbursed."
